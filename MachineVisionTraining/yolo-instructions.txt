HELP: https://timebutt.github.io/static/how-to-train-yolov2-to-detect-custom-objects/

TRAINING SCRIPT TO RUN: 

darknet.exe detector train <relative path to .data> <relative path to .cfg> <relative path to conv file>

TEST DETECTOR: 

darknet.exe detector test <relative path to .data> <relative path to .cfg> <relative path to .weights>  <relative path to image> 
eg. darknet.exe detector test cfg/obj.data cfg/yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj1000.weights data/testimage.jpg

MY TRAINING GOT INTERUPTED! 

No worries, you can restart at your last weights file through the following: 

darknet.exe detector <relative path to .data> <relative path to .cfg> <relative path to latest .weights>

eg. darknet.exe detector train cfg/obj.data cfg/yolo-obj.cfg yolo-obj_2000.weights
