    These are fully responsible for the management of files, metadata, backup, security indicator writing etc.
    It is broken down into three main scripts:
        - index.js - responsible for watching the raw folder, upon file save to raw folder it appends meta-data to the file and then moves file to the processed cache
        - autoBackup.js - responsible for backing up data to the BACKUP_LOCATIONS denoted in the config.json, watches the processed cache.
        - nasBackup.js - responsible for backing up data to the NAS drive, it watches the first BACKUP_LOCATION and on save it automatically begins to transfer data to NAS location given in config.json
    
    Supplementary scripts are as follows:
        - resetStore.js - **DO NOT RUN AS SUDO** this cleans out the local store and resets to default state - run with: node resetStore.js
        - resetCache.js - **DO NOT RUN AS SUDO** this cleans out the processed cache and resets to default state - run with: node resetCache.js
